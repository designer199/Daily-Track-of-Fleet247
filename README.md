 ## Thoughts
 I am trying to find all the files used for the navigation bar in order to make the nav bar responsive.
 ## Problems that I am facing 
 Even after merging all the related files that I think are used in making the header/navigation the look of of the nav bar is not the same .The profile option is visible in my file but not in fleet247. The color/styles of support button is not chnged even after linking the button.scss in index.html

  ## Thoughts
  Add Booking form is not looking appealing as it should be.I need to work more on styling the elements and changing fonts.
  The inputs are coming out of form border in mobile view.

## Thoughts
I had to redo the navigation bar since  a lot of redundant rules were used . Styling the bootstrap navigation was challenging as I did it the first time using this approach
### Things to be done in nav bar
- [ ] the navbarbar should be closed automatically when user clicks on any link in menu/dropdown.This implemented but it is working for only the top most menu item.
